# Rules: UI Design Best Practices

- Use Ant Design for UI components
- Implement appropriate loading and error states
- Ensure all user input is properly validated
- Implement appropriate fallback UI
- Provide helpful empty states
- Display loading indicators only during user-initiated actions that require waiting:
  * Initial page/content loading
  * User-triggered filter application
  * Form submissions
  * Explicit data refresh requests
- Do not display loading indicators during:
  * Automatic background data refreshes
  * Silent data synchronization after changes
- Use component-specific loading indicators instead of full-page loaders to maintain UI responsiveness during data loading
- Ensure UI stability: components should maintain the same size/dimensions during loading states and empty states
- Implement a consistent notification strategy - mutation hooks are supposed to provide toast message feedback for all operations, not UI components
