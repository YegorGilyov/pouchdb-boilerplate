# Rules: General

## Development Workflow
- Focus on code areas relevant to the task
- Do not modify code unrelated to the task

## Code Structure and Quality
- Keep the codebase clean and organized
- Write code that is up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, and efficient
- Prioritize readability over performance when there's a trade-off
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code; refactor at that point
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially one-time scripts
- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code by checking for existing similar functionality

## Change Management
- Always look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code
- Do not drastically change patterns before trying to iterate on existing ones
- When fixing issues, exhaust all options within existing implementation before introducing new patterns
- If introducing a new pattern becomes necessary, remove the old implementation to avoid duplicate logic
- Avoid making major architectural changes to working features unless explicitly instructed
- Always consider what other code areas might be affected by changes
- Make only requested changes or changes you're confident are well understood

## Environment and Testing
- Write code that accounts for different environments: dev, test, and prod
- Use mocking data only for tests, never for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code affecting dev or prod environments
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Never overwrite .env files without first asking and confirming

## Code Preservation
- Do not remove existing code unless necessary
- Preserve comments and commented-out code
- Only change code formatting when essential for new functionality
- Make no whitespace-only changes
- No additions beyond what's explicitly requested

## Communication
- Reference file names in responses
- Be concise and minimize unnecessary prose
- Express uncertainty when appropriate rather than guessing
- Follow user requirements carefully and to the letter
- Fully implement all requested functionality
- Always provide real file links, not placeholder links
