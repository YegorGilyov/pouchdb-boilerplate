Please read all rules in .cursor/rules and let me know if there is something you don't understand or not ready to follow.

Please review all files in src and tell me what you think.

Please read TDD.md, COMPONENTS.md, and DAL.md, and build this thing out. Make sure you follow all the rules provided. Some important files already exist: `src/types/index.ts`, `src/lib/db.ts`, `src/contexts/PuchDBProvider.tsx` - use those files and do not change them.
